#Description#
My program is kind of a 'lyrics-generator'. It gives one sentence from the chorus of the song "Happy" and one from "Bad day". 
Put them together and you have a really contradictory song! 
You control the sentences from "Happy" by pressing the mouse and the sentences from "Bad Day" by pressing any key. 
I tried using RiTa to switch out some words, rhyme and stuff but it wouldnt work out.. Therefore I decided not to use 
the RiTa functions in my program and just implement some different texts. 


#Materiality in text#
The Bouchardon text says; "The reader manipulates the text, these manipulations giving the text a form of materiality."
It would be the same for my program; the "reader" can decide which sentences should be put together and therefore manipulates
the text herself.
