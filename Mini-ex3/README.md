###Description:###
My throbber shows "a leaf" going clockwise and just a simple dot turning the opposite way around. 
I have also written the text 'Please wait' just to point out the situation of the throbber. 

I've been doing a lot of different codes and changes during the process. I tried out different shapes and rates, 
but must of it I deleted or changed to something simpler. 
I just wanted it to look simple, therefore I've also chosen to keep it in some gentle colors. 


###How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital culture?###
Well.. Is it even possible to do anything 'digital' without programming?
