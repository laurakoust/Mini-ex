I've chosen to do the coding challenge #31 - flappy bird. 

I tried to make the bird change to a random color when pressing space (jumping) but I couldnt make it work.. 
I think maybe it was overruled by some other code in my program.. Therefore I ended up changing the background colors and the pipes. 

The difficulty of this week, was to fulle understand the code given by Shiffman, and not just copy it. 

By using a flowchart you will often simplify some difficult program/question/assignment. 
It will also help you to visualize and make other persons understand your thoughts.
