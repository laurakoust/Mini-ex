Description: The scale to the right shows three "different" things. 
The blue-ish one is just the scale going from 0 degrees to 50. 
The pink one shows the minimum temperature (at the moment - in London) to the maximum. 
The yellow circle shows two things (in one); the location of the circle indicates the temperature and 
the size ofthe circle shows how warm/cold it is by changing the size. 

The cloud's size changes depending on, how much humidity there is at the moment.
The more the humidity, the larger the cloud. 


I've chosen to use the open weather API, mostly because Shiffman told me it was simple ;)


It doesnt need any downloading-stuff, but remember to let your browser read the scripts (yea. I forgot; and freaked out)


My process making this program, was mostly watching the Shiffman video. 
Later on I figured out how to make my own visualization of the weather. The scale, "sun" and cloud.
