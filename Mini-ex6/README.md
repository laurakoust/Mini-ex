#Description#

I've chosen to name this: Babypink infection!
Its just some babypink randomized 'scribble scrabble' that forever goes on.
Theres no way to stop it and at some point everything will be this beautiful babypink color ðŸŒ¸

My program uses randomization, changes over time and also evolves form. 

You see the randomization in where the "drawings" begin and where they "will go next", 
I've set it to start 20 "drawings" (I think of it as; if there were 20 crayons drawing scribble scrabbles 
at the same time) and those 20 never starts at the same spot - try reloading, if you dont believe me ;)
Also their paths are random, so therefore you will never know how it looks after 2 minutes. 
By not having a stroke it looks like one big babypink figure growing larger over time.
