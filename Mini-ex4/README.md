I've created a lot of dots using the 'for loop' function and made it follow the mouse's Y-coordinates - therefore
the whole line of dots will go upwards or downwards at the same time. 
The dots changes colors because I've written 'random(255)' in the filling part. 

I wasnt able to make the keys function as an eraser. So I simply put in some rectangles and filled them with the 
background color and without stroke. To make the keys do different stuff i used the 'if - else if' function.

The dots themselves makes a positive feedback (they never dissapear and there will only be more of them when the mouse
moves) but then the arrow keys can make them go away (for a minute at least üòâ ).
