Coding Process:
I made the cartoon at first, then told the program, that if i press the mouse, there will be a big square.
Because of the big square, you cannot see the cartoon. 

What constitutes a program?
A program is a set of codings. The codes are instructions for the computer to complete a task. 

Reflection on the notion 'error':
I think that an error, is when something denies you, to see something. Like when you press the mouse, at my cartoon, you will not be able to see the cartoon (only the background).
